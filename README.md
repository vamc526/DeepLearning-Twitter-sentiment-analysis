# Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Data using Deep Learning & NLP

In this project,  set out to address Twitter sentiment analysis by utilizing deep learning methods
and placing a strong emphasis on the BERT model. In order to further the automatic categorization of
tweets into positive and negative emotions, we investigated using the "Sentiment140" dataset, which
consists of 1.6 million annotated tweets.
A major participant in our investigation was the BERT model, which is well-known for its contextual
embeddings and robust performance in a range of NLP tasks. Although hyperparameter tweaking is
still in progress, the validation accuracy is 76.9%, which is rather good. This accomplishment
highlights how well the model can identify sentiment subtleties in tweets, which is important for
applications like public opinion tracking, brand management, and market research.
Although we recognize that hyperparameter tuning is not perfect, our work offers important new
perspectives on the potential applications of sophisticated deep learning models for social media
sentiment analysis. Although the accuracy of 76.9% is a great start, we acknowledge that social media
data is dynamic and always changing. To fully use our sentiment analysis algorithms,
hyperparameters will need to be continuously explored, improved, and optimized.
In conclusion,  work highlights the need of sophisticated models such as BERT in handling the
intricacies of sentiment analysis on Twitter. Enhancing sentiment analysis skills in the ever-changing
social media world is centered upon improving accuracy and robust generalization, which we will
continue to pursue by adjusting hyperparameters and exploring novel approaches.
